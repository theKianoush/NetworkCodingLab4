I would say Lab4 was pretty simple once I figured out how to display the senders location and my location properly, because those are key to finding their coordinates on the grid, which are used to calculate the distance between eachother.

To run this would be the say as the previous lab
Right now I have the rows fixed to 4 and columns fixed to 3, but I could easily change that to input whatever value you would like, Thanks!


For compiling the program in previous labs it would be "gcc drone3.c -o drone3"
but in this lab it is "gcc drone4.c -o drone4 -lm" to account for the math functions, and this command is included in the makefile, so all you have to do is run "make" in the terminal
